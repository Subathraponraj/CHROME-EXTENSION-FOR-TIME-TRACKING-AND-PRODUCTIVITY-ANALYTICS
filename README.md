*DESCRIPTION*: The Time Tracker & Productivity Analytics Chrome Extension is designed to help users monitor the time spent on different websites, providing valuable insights into their online activities. This extension automatically records the duration spent on various domains and classifies them as productive or unproductive based on predefined criteria. By tracking browsing habits, users can identify areas where they may be spending excessive time and make informed decisions to enhance their productivity. The extension includes a backend server to store user data and a dashboard that presents analytics in a structured and visually accessible manner. 

When a user opens a website, the extension detects the domain and starts tracking the time spent on it. The background script listens for tab updates and changes in browser activity, ensuring that accurate time calculations are maintained. The collected data is stored locally in the browserâ€™s storage and periodically sent to the backend server, where it is saved in a MongoDB database. The backend, built using Node.js and Express, handles data storage, retrieval, and processing. The stored information is then used to generate reports that help users analyze their browsing patterns over time. 

The extension features a simple yet effective user interface. By clicking on the extension icon, users can view their tracked time directly in the popup window. The popup displays the accumulated time spent on various domains in a structured format, allowing users to quickly assess their online activity. Additionally, users can navigate to a dedicated dashboard hosted on a local server, where detailed analytics are presented. The dashboard fetches stored data from the backend and displays it in a user-friendly manner, enabling users to explore trends and patterns in their web usage. 

One of the key aspects of this project is the classification of websites. The extension categorizes websites into productive and unproductive based on predefined rules. For instance, websites related to work, learning, and research, such as coding platforms and documentation sites, are marked as productive. On the other hand, social media, entertainment, and gaming websites are classified as unproductive. This classification helps users understand how their time is distributed between productive and distracting activities, providing insights that can improve focus and time management. 

To ensure data persistence and accessibility, the backend server connects to a MongoDB database. The database stores time-tracking records, allowing users to retrieve historical data for analysis. The backend also exposes API endpoints to fetch the tracked time data, enabling the dashboard to display meaningful insights. The server listens for incoming requests and processes them efficiently to deliver accurate results. Additionally, error handling mechanisms are implemented to ensure smooth operation and prevent issues such as duplicate entries or data loss. 

The extension is designed to be lightweight and efficient, running in the background without affecting browser performance. It minimizes resource consumption while ensuring that accurate time-tracking information is collected. Users can customize their tracking experience by modifying classification rules or adjusting time thresholds based on their preferences. The weekly productivity reports generated by the extension provide a summary of browsing habits, highlighting trends that can help users optimize their online activities. 

Overall, the Time Tracker & Productivity Analytics Chrome Extension serves as a valuable tool for individuals seeking to enhance their productivity by gaining better control over their web usage. By offering real-time tracking, website classification, and detailed analytics, this extension empowers users to develop healthier digital habits and make more informed decisions about their online time management.
